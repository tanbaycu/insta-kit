## Overview

**insta-kit** is a Node.js + Python automation suite that extracts Instagram handles from TikTok comment sections, validates account quality via browser-based heuristics, executes follow campaigns through a Puppeteer-driven stealth layer, and periodically prunes non-reciprocal follows via Instagram's internal GraphQL API.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 18.x |
| Python | ≥ 3.10 |
| Google Chrome | Latest stable |
| Puppeteer | Bundled via `npm install` |

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/tanbaycu/insta-kit.git
cd insta-kit
npm install

# 2. Initialize pipeline data files from templates
copy ig_list.txt.example ig_list.txt
copy ig_done.txt.example ig_done.txt
copy list_video_tiktok.txt.example list_video_tiktok.txt

# For Gilgamesh secondary account
copy gilgamesh\id_list_gil.txt.example gilgamesh\id_list_gil.txt

# 3. Populate TikTok video links (one URL per line)
#    Edit list_video_tiktok.txt with target video URLs

# 4. Launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled
start_chrome.bat                      # main account
# gilgamesh\start_chrome_gil.bat      # secondary account

# 5. Sign in to Instagram inside the launched Chrome window
```

> **Template files** (`.txt.example`) are committed to the repository as empty scaffolds.
> All runtime data files (`.txt`) are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Pipeline

```
[TikTok Videos] ──1.js──► ig_list.txt
                                │
                    ──3.js──► (validated handles)
                                │
                    ──2.js──► ig_done.txt
                                │
                (periodically) ──6.js──► unfollow non-reciprocal
```

Run each stage in a separate terminal for continuous parallelism:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Scrape
node 1.js

# Terminal 2 — Validate
node 3.js

# Terminal 3 — Follow
node 2.js

# Terminal 4 — Prune (run periodically, every few days)
node 6.js
```

**`6.js` interactive prompt:**
- `1` — Unfollow all non-reciprocal accounts
- `2` — Unfollow only accounts followed by this tool (`ig_done.txt` cross-reference)

## Secondary Account — Gilgamesh Engine (`2_gil.js`)

`2_gil.js` is architecturally the most advanced executor in the suite. It is not a simplified copy of `2.js` — it implements a distinct, hardened follow engine designed for resilience and stealth.

### Key Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|---|---|
| **Page Visibility Spoofing** | Overrides `document.visibilityState` and suppresses `visibilitychange` events at document level, preventing Instagram from detecting tab-switching or backgrounding — keeps the session active indefinitely |
| **Search-Based Navigation** | Instead of direct URL injection (`/username/`), navigates via Instagram's native search bar with human-simulated typing (`delay: 90ms/char`) — mimics organic user behavior to bypass pattern detection |
| **Multi-Attempt Follow Retry** | `for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)` retry loop per profile — retries up to 5 times per target with incremental waits before marking as failed |
| **Dual-Path Click Fallback** | Primary: `ElementHandle.click()` with randomized click delay (30–80ms). Fallback: `page.evaluate(e => e.click())` in-page JS click — survives Puppeteer `detached frame` errors |
| **Post-Click State Verification** | After clicking Follow, reads the button's `innerText` to confirm state changed to `following / đang theo dõi / requested` before logging success — no false positives |
| **Auto-Reset on 2 Consecutive Failures** | `consecutiveErrors >= 2` triggers a hard reload to `instagram.com` — flushes rate-limit signals and soft-block states without restarting the process |
| **In-Memory Dedup Lock** | `isProcessingSet` (Set) prevents re-queuing the same username mid-cycle in concurrent contexts — race-condition safe |
| **Dynamic Random Rest** | 10,000–18,000ms randomized inter-follow delay — significantly longer than `2.js`, tuned specifically to evade Gilgamesh account-level rate limiting |
| **Session File Hot-Reload** | Re-reads session and done-list files on every loop iteration — allows external injection of new targets while the bot is running, zero restart required |
| **Isolated Data Namespace** | All I/O (`id_list_gil.txt`, `ig_done_gil.txt`, `session_follow_gilgamesh.txt`) is fully decoupled from the main account pipeline |

### Why it's stronger than `2.js`

- `2.js` navigates by direct URL; `2_gil.js` uses the **search interface** — far harder to fingerprint as automated
- `2_gil.js` includes **visibility state spoofing** — missing from `2.js`
- **5× retry loop** vs single-attempt in `2.js`
- **Dual-path click fallback** handles detached frame errors that cause `2.js` to skip profiles
- **Auto-reset circuit breaker** vs manual intervention in `2.js`

```bash
# Launch dedicated Chrome instance (remote debug port 9223)
gilgamesh\start_chrome_gil.bat

# Sign in to the Gilgamesh Instagram account in Chrome

# Run executor
node gilgamesh/2_gil.js
```

## API Executor (Python)

`4_api_follow.py` interfaces directly with Instagram's private API for high-throughput follow operations — bypasses browser overhead with spoofed headers.

```bash
pip install requests
python 4_api_follow.py
```

> Requires a valid session cookie configured inside the script.
